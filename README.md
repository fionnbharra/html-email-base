html-email-base
===============

Starting point for html emails

HTML emails are horrible, horrible things. If I really wanted my email to contain anything other than text I'd look at a webpage and not an email. Or a magazine, or a photo, or out the window. Anywhere but an email.


This starter pack is a combination of [email boilerplate](https://github.com/seanpowell/Email-Boilerplate) and [premailer](https://github.com/alexdunae/premailer/)


How to use 
==========

Clone.
Make changes to email_source.html. Have a look at the comments in the file for instructions on how to use. 

Run Rake

Check your output folder.

Test your output, maybe using Litmus. Litmus takes ages to do anything so make sure you have something else to do.
